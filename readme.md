Single page website built as a final project for my HTML/CSS course. Omnifood is a
fictional company focused on providing AI-based meals through a subscription service.

## Key Features :

Having created the website from scratch, I learned how to create and implement features that I'm likely to use in my future websites over and over again. Here are some of the key features and topics that I worked on:

- Hamburger menu (mobile-navigation) that appears on tablet-sized or smaller screens.
- Smooth scrolling whenever any navigation links (from header and footer) are clicked
- Subtle animations and stiky navigation bar that trigger when a certain viewport rule is met (e.g. element is in viewport or element is not in viewport) using `IntersectionObserver`
- Added cross-broswer support for certain CSS styles using prefixes (`-webkit`, `-moz-`, `-o-`, `-ms-`)

- Functional form ðŸ’Œ
- Fully responsive thanks to media queries âœ¨
- Utilized css-grid (for bigger layouts), flexbox(for smaller sections) and absolute positioning
